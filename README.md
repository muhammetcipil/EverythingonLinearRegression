# EverythingonLinearRegression

Hello everyone,

In this notebook,I tried to predict house prices with a linear regression model using the California house Price dataset.

And in addition, I left additional resources on how we should evaluate the assumptions if our data were suitable for the model.

Since the data we had was not very suitable for the linear model, our model did not work very efficiently. But my purpose here was to show step by step the process required to create a linear regression model from raw data to model.

Please keep in mind that I am still learning, so if you spot any incorrect explanations or anything, please let me know. Enjoy your journey, as well.
